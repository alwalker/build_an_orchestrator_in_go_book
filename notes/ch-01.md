- I chuckled at the idea that the certified AIX app was ever gonna go away
- interested in how metrics collection on tasks is going to work
- also interested in the different data stores we're going to have to use
- we're totally using podman right?
- this will be a great excuse to fuck around with both hardware and some vm automation
- what would it take to add "service discovery"
- can we make ha manager? (shared state plus consensus tooling)
- LB -> RR DNS?
