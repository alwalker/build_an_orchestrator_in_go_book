- why are we re creating these objects every time instead of starting by pulling them into the db?
  - it already has a pointer to the task object in the db...
- hella leaky docker abstraction
- it looks like go fmt doesn't eat my new lines anymore
- go case statements are ugly
- tasks aren't tasks but representations of a task at a point in time
